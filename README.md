Try the functionality here:




This time I wanted to expand on the redux kit and try the react-redux kit to see what it offered in terms of making the redux arcitechture easier to code. It was fantastic to use. The useSelector and usedispatch hooks are great to use and gives the coder much more power. The only import necessary is in the index.js file, to import the store and wrap the <App/> in <Provider> tags.

All in all, I learned a lot, and I made the store much better and easier to maintain. In fact, I used the store much more actively, especially when rendering the navbar cart functionality. In my redux test I used a state hook, but I decided to expand on my store state object and utilize its full functionality for this test.

The react-redux kit is excellent and after mastering the plain redux kit, the react-redux kit offers so much more power to the coder, and allows for much more flexibility, and more space to expand on the store and make it a larger central system in the application.

Things I want to fix:
    I would like to add a total at the bottom, which is simple. I will do it soon.
    I would like to add a circle behind the cart icon, maybe red, and the number in white, to clearly indicate items in the cart
    I would like to add more conditionals to keep everything in check in terms of edge cases, and so on
    
    there is much more I would like to do. I will add more to this list soon.
